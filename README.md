# I will use this readme as a sort of diary for the progress of this little project.

First, a confession: My dev carreer did not go beyond the tech boom during the 2020 pandemic.
Due to personal reasons, I was let go from my dev job in 2022 and did not manage to get a new job in the area, now, IT serves a an ever present ghost of "What could have been", both in a professional, intellectual and in a compensation point of view.

So, 3 years after being let go, I decided to do what I should have done since the beginning. **practicing with something that I enjoy, instead of copying an infinite list of tutorials**

So this is my little pet project.

- Started this project, struggled a little bit lauching the page to github pages.
- The stack is React, Vite and Tailwind Css

## 07/22/2025
- Decided to start this little diary. Better than the generic React Readme.md.
- Adding some components, thinking of **adding pagination** to the page in order to track progress
- Defaulted to dark mode since deving in a dark room hurts when the default is white **Want to implement a trigger for dark/light mode**
- Starting Footer and header components, they are useless at the moment

## 07/27/2025
- Adding react-paginate, trying to add update dates as labels
